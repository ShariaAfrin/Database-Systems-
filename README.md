Project Link: [Here](https://github.com/ShariaAfrin/Database-Systems-/tree/main/Project)

A miniature website was designed by a group of 3 people as a database project. The purpose of the project was to design a website where the user can register/login to search for their desired books and get information like the author, publisher, published date.
Also, the user can give feedback about the books that they have read and rate them. 
The author can view the feedbacks and ratings given by the user.
